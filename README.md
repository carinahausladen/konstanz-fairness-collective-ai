# Fairness and Collective Decision-Making in AI
**Summer Semester 2026 · University of Konstanz**


This seminar introduces analytical methods for studying fairness, bias, and participation in AI from a social science perspective. 
The course focuses on understanding, evaluating, and interpreting their societal and political implications. 
It builds on political theory, social choice, and fairness concepts to analyze AI methods critically, emphasizing qualitative reasoning alongside computational evaluation.

## Learning Goals

- Research overview: Students will be able to systematically map and critically synthesize the current research literature on fairness, bias, and collective decision-making in AI, with a focus on large language models and emerging applications.
- Theory development: Students will be able to critically evaluate and develop normative and theoretical arguments about fairness, alignment, and democratic legitimacy in AI systems, engaging with competing perspectives and identifying conceptual tensions.
- Research design: Students will be able to critically assess and justify research designs used to study fairness and deliberation in AI, including the choice of evaluation metrics, benchmarks, and qualitative or quantitative methods, and reflect on their ethical and societal implications.

## Course Evaluation and Format

- Hands-on analysis of models, metrics, and datasets  
- Student presentations and written papers

## Activities and Assessment

### Reading Notes (ungraded, required)

Short written notes to support careful reading and active participation. For each core reading, students should briefly address:

- **Core contribution:** What problem does the paper address, and how does it contribute to current debates on AI fairness, alignment, or deliberation?
- **Conceptual and methodological approach:** Which key concepts, assumptions, or evaluation strategies does the paper rely on?
- **Critical questions:** What is unclear, contestable, or underdeveloped in the argument or analysis?
- **Research outlook:** Which aspect of the paper could be further developed, refined, or connected to other literature, and why?

These notes are not graded, but they are **required preparation** for seminar discussions, presentations, and the final paper.


### Discussant Role (graded, 30%)

Each student serves once as a discussant for one core reading.

**Responsibilities:**
- Read the assigned paper in depth, including its conceptual framework, assumptions, and evaluation choices.
- Identify strengths, limitations, and open questions relevant to fairness, alignment, or democratic implications.
- Frame the paper as a contribution to an ongoing research debate rather than a finished account.
- Prepare a small number of slides summarizing:
  - the research question and main argument,
  - key conceptual or methodological choices,
  - concrete directions for further research or theoretical extension.

**Format:**
- 12–15 minute presentation  
- 5–8 minutes of guided discussion with prepared prompts  

The goal is to foster **research-oriented and theory-aware discussion**, not to defend or critique the paper for its own sake.


### Research Paper Project (graded, 70%)

The final paper is the core component of the seminar. Students work individually or in small groups to develop an original research paper that builds on the course literature.

**Project goals:**
- Identify a well-defined research question related to fairness, bias, alignment, or AI-supported deliberation.
- Situate the question clearly within the existing literature.
- Develop a theoretically grounded argument and, where appropriate, a critical assessment of existing methods, metrics, or design choices.
- Reflect on normative, ethical, or political implications.

**Expected output:**
- A paper-style report (~8 pages / 4,000–8,000 words), including:
  - research question and motivation,
  - literature review and conceptual framework,
  - analytical or methodological approach,
  - discussion of findings, limitations, and implications.

Empirical replication or original data collection is **optional** and not required; strong conceptual, theoretical, or design-oriented contributions are equally valid.

**Deliverables & milestones:**
- Project proposal presentation (ungraded)
- Writing outline checkpoint (ungraded)
- Final presentation (graded)
- Final paper submission (graded)

Clear and rigorous communication—through writing, argumentation, and presentation—is considered an essential component of the project.
